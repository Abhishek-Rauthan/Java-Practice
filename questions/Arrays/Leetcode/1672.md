# 1672. Richest Customer Wealth

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the ith customer has in the jth bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

example:
accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] accounts = {{1, 5}, {7, 3}, {3, 5}};
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int row = accounts.length;
        int col = accounts[0].length;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                sum += accounts[i][j];
            }
            if (sum > max) {
                max = sum;
            }
            sum = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
```
