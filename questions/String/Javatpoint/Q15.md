# Java Program to find maximum and minimum occurring character in a string.

In this program, we need to count each character present in the string and find out the maximum and minimum occurring  character.

> Grass is greener on the other side

### Java Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Grass is greener on the other side";

        char[] arr = str.toCharArray();

        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (char s : arr) {
            if (map.containsKey(s)) {
                map.compute(s, (k, freq)-> freq + 1);
            } else if (s == ' '){
                continue;
            } else {
                map.put(s, 1);
            }
        }

        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, max = 0;
        char minKey = '\0', maxKey = '\0';

        for (char s : map.keySet()) {
            int value = map.get(s);

            if (value > max) {
                max = value;
                maxKey = s;
            }

            if (value < min) {
                min = value;
                minKey = s;
            }
        }

        System.out.printf("The min frequency is of character '%s' and its %s", minKey, min);
        System.out.printf("\nThe max frequency is of character '%s' and its %s", maxKey, max);
        map.clear();
    }
}
```

### Output:
```shell
The min frequency is of character 'a' and its 1
The max frequency is of character 'e' and its 6
```
